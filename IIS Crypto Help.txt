IIS Crypto Help

The following are the switches for the command line version of IIS Crypto. All parameters are optional.


Switch		Option			Description
/backup		<filename>		Specify a file to backup the current registry settings too.

/template	default			This template restores the server to the default settings.

best		This template sets your server to use the best practices for TLS. It aims to be compatible with as many browsers as possible while disabling weak protocols and
			cipher suites.

pci32		This template is used to make your server PCI 3.2 compliant. It will disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 which may break client connections to your website. Please make 
			sure that RDP will continue to function as Windows 2008 R2 requires an update. See our FAQ for more information.
strict		This template sets your server to use the strictest settings possible. It will disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and all non forward secrecy cipher suites which may break
			client connections to your website. Please make sure that RDP will continue to function as Windows 2008 R2 requires an update. See our FAQ for more information.

fips140		This template makes your server FIPS 140-2 compliant. It is similar to the Best Practices template, however, it is not as secure as Best Practices because some
			of the weaker cipher suites are enabled.

<filename>	Specify the filename of a template to use.

/reboot		Reboot the server after a template is applied.

/help|?		Show the help screen.


EXAMPLE.
iiscryptocli /backup backup.reg /template "C:\temp\MyServers.ictpl" /reboot

Here is an example that backs up the registry to a file named backup.reg, applies a custom template named MyServers.ictpl and reboots the server.
